        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Banana Bread Recipe is loaded with ripe bananas, tangy-sweet raisins, and toasted walnuts. It is one of our favorite ripe banana recipes and even better with overripe bananas.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 very ripe bananas, (medium/large)</li>
            <li>½ cup unsalted butter, (8 Tbsp) at room temperature</li>
            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>½ tsp salt</li>
            <li>½ tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup walnuts</li>
            <li>½ cup raisins</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease and flour a bread loaf pan (9.25 long x 5.25 wide x 2.75 deep). Lightly roast walnuts on a skillet, continuously stirring so they won’t burn. Coarsely chop and cool to room temperature. </li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, cream together 8 Tbsp softened butter and 3/4 cup sugar (or honey if using honey).</li>
            <li>Mash bananas with a fork until the consistency of chunky applesauce and add them to the batter along with 2 eggs, mixing until blended. </li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together: 1 1/2 cups of flour, 1 tsp of baking soda and 1/2 tsp of salt then add to batter.</li>
            <li>Add 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and mix in chopped walnuts and raisins. Pour into prepared loaf pan. Bake at 350˚F for 55-60 min or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let banana bread rest for 10 min before transferring to a wire rack to cool.</li>
        </ol>
